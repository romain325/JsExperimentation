# Donut

## Introduction

Pretty well known in the coding community, the moving donut is a basic of "let's understand math and everything".  
Tbh it isn't that hard but use multiple pretty cool techniques to get down, so let's dive into it.  
We need to work with multiple techniques such as Rotation matrix, Projection Equation and some surface normalization for the display.  
Mathematically speaking, we're talking about a Torus, which is a combinaison of 2D circle aligned on a 2D circle defined on another plan.
